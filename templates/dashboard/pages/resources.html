                                       At first use of YARA dashboard, any person might feel  that a lot restrictions are placed on the content and images
                                       that can be uploaded. Naturally, the question will arise as to why we adhere to such strict guidelines. We do understand
                                       your concerns, but let us assure you that following the guidelines will make sure the users have a memorable experience
                                       using the Yara. While designing Yara, we have taken into consideration the views and opinions of all the stakeholders
                                       involved in Event Management industry be it the Organisers, Sponsors, Exhibitors and the Delegates. Design was done
                                       is such a way that the user will never for a moment get bored using Yara. And the app that you see today is the 
                                       culmination of that effort. It has got the right mix of what each group desires. We have also made sure that interests of
                                       one group (e.g: Organiser) does not overlap that of the other (e.g.: Delegates) and vice versa. It is in this regard we have
                                       come up with such restrictions. A quality app will enhance the overall experience of the Event.<br/><br/>

                                       Sponsors are the key to any event's success and we realise their importance. User experience and Advertisements usually
                                       don't go hand in hand. Too many Ads leads to a nightmarish User experience and too less Ads would mean less revenue 
                                       for the Organisers. The success lies in finding the right balance. So we have come up with AdSpace which is a tailor made 
                                       Advertisement solution from Yara. It's an easy to use solution. Once you have purchased the desired Ad package, all you 
                                       need to do is to upload the images or videos. Our Smart Delivery system makes sure that the Ads will be displayed to the 
                                       users at the appropriate time. We have made sure that the Pulse cannot be flooded with Ads as this will compromise the 
                                       User Experience.<br/><br/>
                                       The AdSpace feature also comes with inbuilt analytics. So you can get to know the effectiveness of each Ad campaign 
                                       (no:of views, overall interaction to name a few) AdSpace is the only medium to post Ads on Yara. Organisers should 
                                       make use of AdSpace in order of post Ads. Yara reserves the right to take Ads posted outside of AdSpace.<br/><br/>
                                       <div class="resource-guide-font">Vote</div>
                                       <br/>
                                       Organisers can put to Vote questions ensuring better interaction with the delegates. A few facts to keep in mind while
                                       creating Vote are mentioned below.<br/><br/>
                                       <ul>
                                          <li>Questions should be relevant to the event being held</li>
                                          <li>Feedback questions cannot put to Vote (Feedback regarding sessions, food, venue, etc).</li>
                                          <li>Questions must be clear and concise</li>
                                          <br/><br/>
                                       </ul>
                                       The results of the Vote will be visible to the delegates once he/she chooses to vote. Asking for feedback using Vote will 
                                       give away the feedback to the delegates. So it is not at all recommend to use Vote to gather feedback. Our automated 
                                       feedback system will ensure you get the right feedback from the delegates.<br/><br/>
                                       <div class="resource-guide-font">Feedback</div>
                                       <br/>
                                       There are multiple options for Organisers to get real time feedback from the Delegates. Yara InSights provide live feedback 
                                       about the various sessions, speakers, exhibitors and sponsors. Along with the InSights, at the end of each day/event Yara's 
                                       feedback system puts forth a pre defined set of Feedback questions. We do ensure that these feedback queries will be 
                                       presented in a very user friendly manner, thereby increasing the chances of genuine feedback from the Delegates.
                                       As we had mentioned earlier, Yara will handle the feedback process automatically. Organisers should not use any other 
                                       medium to get user feedback.<br/><br/>
                                       <div class="resource-guide-font">Image Quality</div>
                                       <br/>
                                       We have put a lot of effort and thought in the design and quality of Yara. As a result of this, you have access to an app that
                                       has unparalleled quality. We expect our users to also maintain the same quality standards. Thus we have introduced certain
                                       criteria for the images and videos that are to be uploaded.<br/><br/>
                                       <ul>
                                          <li>Event Logo - TBD</li>
                                          <li>Cover Image - TBD</li>
                                          <li>Pinned Images (User Pulse) - TBD</li>
                                          <li>Pinned Images (Sponsor/Exhibitor) - TBD</li>
                                          <li>AdSpace - Poster - TBD</li>
                                          <li>AdSpace - Motion - TBD</li>
                                          <br/><br/>
                                       </ul>
                                       By default, the Yara system will not allow images and videos that do not meet the above said quality specs.<br/><br/>
                                       Make use of our "Smart Delivery System"<br/><br/>
                                       We have come up with our unique system called "Smart Delivery". The system which allows the Organisers to upload the
                                       images/videos/text. Upon doing so, the system ensures that the Images, videos and text are delivered at the right time to
                                       the delegates thereby increasing its effectiveness. Smart Delivery option can be used for various features like AdSpace, 
                                       Vote, Coupons and ShareBox. Smart Delivery system works on an algorithm which ensures that the desired content is 
                                       pushed to the users at the right time without spoiling the user experience.<br/><br/>
                                       Of course, the organisers can push content anytime they choose to. But we strongly recommend using Smart Delivery 
                                       which in turn will help you in cutting down time and effort. You no longer need to run around thinking what is the best 
                                       time to post an Ad. Our Smart Delivery has it covered.<br/><br/>
                                       <div class="resource-guide-font">Event name and date</div>
                                       <br/>
                                       Most events are planned very well in advance. Hence any changes to Name and date are extremely rare. We do not allow
                                       organisers to edit the Event name and date once the Event has been created. Despite this, if an Organiser wishes to change
                                       the Event name and date, they can raise a ticket regarding the same using HappyHelp and our Support team will review 
                                       and make the necessary changes.<br/><br/>
                                       <div class="resource-guide-font">Free Events</div>
                                       <br/>
                                       At the outset, we would like to make it very clear that only certain organisations which fall in the following categories NGOs,
                                       Non Profits, Charity are eligible to apply for free event. Applications from organisations outside the specified list will not be
                                       entertained. Relevant organisations can contact Yara Team directly mentioning the complete details of the proposed event.
                                       Each application will be reviewed on a case to case basis. Yara holds the right to accept/reject an application based on 
                                       aforementioned criteria. If an application is accepted, a YaraKey will be sent directly to the Organiser Inbox. The YaraKey
                                       will be applicable only for that particular event and cannot be redeemed for any other event.<br/><br/>

                                       <br/>
                                       Organisers must ensure that content containing sexually explicit material, violence, bullying, hate speech based on race,
                                       religion, disability, gender, age, nationality, sexual orientation etc must not find its way to the user pulse. Utmost care must
                                       be taken while uploading content in the dashboard. Voris hold the right to take down any content that does not meet the
                                       above mentioned criteria.<br/>

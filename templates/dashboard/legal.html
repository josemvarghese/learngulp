<legal-bold>2. How we Collect Information</legal-bold><br/>
Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies. Like many
website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as
Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.<br/><br/>
<legal-bold>a. “Cookies”</legal-bold> are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web
server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and
persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell
us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to
monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to
customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session
Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your 
browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can
change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to
prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t
accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the
Services. We may engage third party services providers, who may also place
their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Data and Privacy Policy
covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such
third parties.<br/><br/>
<legal-bold>b. “Web Beacons”</legal-bold> (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny
graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for
several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track
and measure the performance of our Services and to monitor how many
visitors view our Services. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s
hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or
in an e-mail).<br/><br/>
<legal-bold>c. Information Related to Use of the Services.</legal-bold><br/>

Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may
include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser
type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing
our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed
and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our
Services that a User clicked on, commands executed when using our Services,
features of the Services accessed, information about the types and size of files
analyzed via the Services, and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer
the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log 
Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their
features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and
preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, nonidentifying
information about how our Services are used.<br/><br/>
